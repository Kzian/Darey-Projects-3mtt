# INTRODUCTION TO JENKINS

# üìò Jenkins CI/CD Setup and Walkthrough on Amazon Linux 2023

## üß© **Introduction to CI/CD**

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared repository several times a day, with automated testing and builds.
**Continuous Delivery (CD)** extends this by automating the release process, so deployments can happen on demand with minimal manual intervention.

Together, CI/CD fosters faster, more reliable, and more automated software development workflows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **What is Jenkins?**

[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io) is an open-source automation server widely used to implement CI/CD workflows. It supports:

* Automatic building, testing, and deployment of applications
* Integration with Git and other version control systems
* Extensible pipelines defined as code
* A large ecosystem of plugins

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Goals

By the end of this project, learners will:

* Understand CI/CD principles
* Master Jenkins installation and configuration
* Automate builds, tests, and deployments
* Apply best practices like parameterized builds, external integrations, and Docker usage

# üöÄ Jenkins Setup Walkthrough (Amazon Linux 2023)

### üß± 1. Install Java

Before that, update the EC2 instance:

```bash
sudo yum update
```

![update](img/update.png)

Jenkins requires Java 11 or 17. For Amazon Linux 2023:

```bash
sudo dnf install java-17-amazon-corretto -y
```

![java](img/java.png)

Verify:

```bash
java -version
```

Expected output:

```
openjdk version "17.0.15" ...
```

![javav](img/javav.png)

### üì¶ 2. Install Jenkins

#### a. Add the Jenkins repo and key

```bash
sudo curl --silent --location https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
```

#### b. Install Jenkins

```bash
sudo dnf install jenkins -y
```

![jenkins](img/jenk.png)

### üîÅ 3. Configure Jenkins to Avoid Port Conflicts

![enable1](img/jenkena1.png)

If a sevice/process (in this case, docker is using the port) is using port 8080, the above error will be encountered. Do the following:

If `docker` or another process is using port 8080:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :8080
```

Change Jenkins port to 8090:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service.d
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service.d/override.conf
```

Add:

```ini
[Service]
Environment="JENKINS_PORT=8090"
```

Apply and restart:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
```

![enable2](img/jenkena2.png)

### üîß 4. Open EC2 Inbound Port

In EC2:

* Go to **Security Groups** ‚Üí **Inbound rules**
* Add:

  * **Type**: Custom TCP
  * **Port**: `8090`
  * **Source**: `0.0.0.0/0` (or more secure source)

## Check this on how to edit inbound rules for your instance: [Working_with_docker_images](https://github.com/Kzian/Darey-Projects-3mtt/blob/main/Working_with_docker_imgs/README.md)

![editin](img/editin.png)

### üåê 5. Access Jenkins in Browser

1. Go to: `http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8090`
2. Unlock Jenkins:

   ```bash
   sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   ```
3. Follow setup wizard:

   * Install suggested plugins
   * **(Important)** Create a user account

     * If missed, you can create one later from the **Manage Jenkins > Manage Users** panel
     * Or via Groovy script override (as shown previously)

![login2](img/login2.png)

![login3](img/login3.png)

![login4](img/login4.png)

## üîë Managing Jenkins Users (Missed Account Creation)

If you missed creating a user during setup, do the following:

### Use UI

* Log in using the initial admin password
* Go to: **Manage Jenkins > Manage Users > Create User**


Then restart Jenkins.

# üì¶ Jenkins Freestyle Project ‚Äì Build Automation

### What is a Freestyle Project?

A Jenkins **freestyle project** is a basic job type to automate tasks like:

* Compiling code
* Running tests
* Packaging apps
* Deploying builds

## üèóÔ∏è Walkthrough: Creating a Freestyle Job

### 1. From the Jenkins Dashboard

* Click **New Item**
* Name it: `my-first-job`
* Choose **Freestyle project**
* Click **OK**

![new](img/newitem.png)

![new1](img/newitem1.png)

### 2. Connect to GitHub

Create a GitHub repo `jenkins-scm` with a `README.md`.

![readme](img/readme.png)

Then in Jenkins:

* Go to **Configure** the project
* Under **Source Code Management**, select **Git**
* Enter repo URL:
  `https://github.com/your-username/jenkins-scm.git`
* Set branch to `main`

![new2](img/newitem2.png)

![new3](img/newitem3.png)

### 3. Build Now

Click **Build Now** to verify the job runs.

![build](img/build.png)

## üîî Configure Build Trigger with Webhook

### Automate builds on GitHub changes

#### i. In Jenkins:

* Go to **Configure > Build Triggers**
* Select: **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**
* Save

![trigger](img/trigger.png)

#### ii. On GitHub:

* Go to **Settings > Webhooks** for the repo
* Add a webhook:

  * Payload URL: `http://<your-EC2-public-ip>:8090/github-webhook/`
  * Content type: `application/json`

![wh](img/webh.png)

![wh1](img/webhook.png)

![wh2](img/webhook1.png)

![wh3](img/webhook2.png)

![wh4](img/webhook3.png)



Now, any GitHub push will auto-trigger a Jenkins build.

Test by editing and committing `README.md`.

## ‚ùó Errors Encountered and Solutions Applied

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **1. Jenkins failed to start**

**Error:**

```
Job for jenkins.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
```

**Cause:** Port 8080 was already in use by Docker.

**Solution:**

* Created a systemd override to change Jenkins port to `8090`
* Restarted Jenkins using:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl restart jenkins
  ```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **2. Skipped user creation during setup wizard**

**Problem:** Couldn‚Äôt create a new admin account after initial setup.

**Solution:**

* Created an admin user using a Groovy script placed in `/var/lib/jenkins/init.groovy.d/`
* Restarted Jenkins to apply

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **3. GitHub repository not accessible**

**Error:**

```
Failed to connect to repository: Error performing git command...
```

**Cause:** Missing Git or credentials for private repo

**Solution:**

* Installed Git via `sudo dnf install git -y`
* Added GitHub Personal Access Token in Jenkins credentials
* Reconfigured job to use proper credentials

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **4. Job stuck in ‚Äúpending‚Äù**

**Symptom:** Jenkins job stayed in queue, showing:

```
Waiting for next available executor
```

**Causes and Fixes:**

* Built-in node was initially offline ‚Üí marked it online
* Executors were misconfigured ‚Üí set to 2
* Jenkins was blocked due to failed health check for `/tmp` space

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **5. Jenkins disk space warning**

**Error:**

```
Disk space is below threshold of 1.00 GiB. Only 470.20 MiB left on /tmp.
```

**Cause:** `/tmp` was a RAM-based `tmpfs` limited to \~475MB

**Solution:**

* Configured Jenkins to use `/var/tmp` by overriding `JAVA_OPTS` in systemd:

  ```ini
  Environment="JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.io.tmpdir=/var/tmp"
  ```
* Restarted Jenkins
